This project focuses on the analysis of two key datasets:
1. **Worldwide Female Workforce Participation**: Historical data on women's labor force participation rates from various countries.
2. **U.S. Educational Attainment**: Data on the total number of degrees awarded to women across different fields in the United States.

The project explores potential correlations between womenâ€™s workforce participation globally and educational attainment in the U.S., uncovering trends and insights into female representation in the labor market and academia.

## Project Overview
